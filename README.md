# CIS3110-Project-3

- github repository with all the demonstrated steps, complete for the entire React.js project (to do list system)

- Take an array of data and form a UI around it. This might take the form of a to-do list, or other list which appears as a set of UI elements, like text inputs
- A button should update the array of data, deleting and adding to it
- The page should run from your node.js server, running react.js
- Data should be input by the user, then your UI should update, in real time
- Utilize the react.js ideas of components, jsx, props and state
- Utilize mainstream developer tools such as Cloud9/AWS, atom, then the Chrome developer tools to highlight problem code, and narrow down errors (react tools for Chrome)
